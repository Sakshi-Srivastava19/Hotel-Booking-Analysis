Hotel-Booking-Analysis
🚀 Exploring Hotel Booking Trends with Python! 📊🏨

I recently worked on an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project using the Hotel Bookings dataset. The goal? To uncover patterns in hotel reservations, cancellations, and seasonality trends.**This task was provided by catalys company for the role as Data Analyst Intern**

🔍 Key Insights:
✔️ Identified peak booking months and seasonality patterns 📆
✔️ Analyzed cancellation rates and proposed strategies to reduce them ❌📉
✔️ Visualized booking trends for City vs. Resort hotels

🛠️ Tech Stack:
✅ Pandas for data wrangling
✅ Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations
✅ Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

📊 Check out the project on GitHub: https://github.com/Sakshi-Srivastava19/Hotel-Booking-Analysis/
💡 What strategies do you think hotels should adopt to reduce cancellations? Let's discuss! 👇

2️⃣ Add Media
Attach a few key visualizations (like booking trends or cancellation rates).

Include a snapshot of your Jupyter Notebook or a short video walkthrough.

3️⃣
Include a well-structured README.md explaining the project.

Would you like me to draft a README file for your GitHub repo? 🚀
